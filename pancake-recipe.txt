In a large bowl, sift together 2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon sugar.
Make a well in the center and pour in 1 1/2 cup of milk, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon of olive oil,
and 1/4 cup of mineral wather; mix until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the frying pan,
using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
